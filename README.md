# Netflix-Project
With so many movies and tv shows out there, it is becoming harder and harder to make selections on what to watch. This program uses data from the Kaggle dataset named Netflix Movies and TV Shows by Shivam Bansal and allows you to make a selection on what to watch based on your preferences. The program will ask you questions such as 'What is your preferred genre?',  'Are there any actors or actresses you would like to see in your selection?', 'Would you prefer a movie or tv show?', etc. to filter the original dataset to match your preferences. It will then randomly select three movies from the dataframe and print out their title, description, year, imdb rating, and rotten tomatoes rating to the console. I wrote this program as a way to practice pandas, numpy, and webscraping principles. This is not meant for commercial use.
